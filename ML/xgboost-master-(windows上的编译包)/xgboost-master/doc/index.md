XGBoost Documentation
=====================
This is document of xgboost library.
XGBoost is short for eXtreme gradient boosting. This is a library that is designed, and optimized for boosted (tree) algorithms.
The goal of this library is to push the extreme of the computation limits of machines to provide a ***scalable***, ***portable*** and ***accurate***
for large scale tree boosting.

How to Get Started
------------------
The best way to get started to learn xgboost is by the examples. There are three types of examples you can find in xgboost.
* [Tutorials](#tutorials) are self-contained tutorials on complete data science tasks.
* [XGBoost Code Examples](../demo/) are collections of code and benchmarks of xgboost.
  - There is a walkthrough section in this to walk you through specific API features.
* [Highlight Solutions](#highlight-solutions) are presentations using xgboost to solve real world problems.
  - These examples are usually more advanced. You can usually find state-of-art solutions to many problems and challenges in here.

After you gets familiar with the interface, checkout the following additional resources
* [Frequently Asked Questions](faq.md)
* [Learning what is in Behind: Introduction to Boosted Trees](model.md)
* [User Guide](#user-guide) contains comprehensive list of documents of xgboost.
* [Developer Guide](dev-guide/contribute.md)
